# How to Add Conference

[Conferences Deadlines](https://alldeadlines.info)

We welcome contributions to keep our deadline list accurate and comprehensive. If you want to add or update a conference, you have two options:

1.  **Submit a Pull Request on GitHub**: Fork the repository, edit the `conferences.json` file, and submit a pull request with your changes. This is the fastest way to contribute.
2.  **Send me an email**: If you're not familiar with GitHub, simply send an email to [mindw96@unist.ac.kr](mailto:mindw96@unist.ac.kr) with the official website link for the conference you'd like to add.
