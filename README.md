# How to Add Conference

[Conference Deadlines](https://alldeadlines.info)

We welcome contributions to keep our deadline list accurate and comprehensive. If you want to add or update a conference, you have two options:

1.  **Open an Issue on GitHub (Recommended)**: Click on the "Issues" tab in the repository and open a new issue. Please provide the conference name, official website link, and any deadline information you have. This is the best way to request an addition or update.
2.  **Send an Email**: If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can send an email to mindw96@unist.ac.kr with the conference details.
